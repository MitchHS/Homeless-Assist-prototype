# Homeless-Assist-prototype

Android application prototype developed for FairCanberra. Application was completed in Semester 1 2020. 

Application contains Google Places and Google Maps API. 

I will be revoking my token in the near future as of 12/5/20 as it costs money for use. Please add a new one in where neccessary. 
Maps activity has the token listed, just search through the entire project and replace with a new one where neccessary. 

Good luck, have fun.
